      <h2>Technologies used</h2>
      <p>
        As this is a "Full Stack" developed project, many technologies and tooles were used (if a programmer loves something,
        it's using other peoples work to make things easier). As such, this section hass been split subiteration.

        <h3>Productivity</h3>
        <p>
          Even if this is a single developer project, productivity tools are essential to the life of a project.
        </p>
        <p>
          For code management and distribution, the marvelous <a href="https://https://github.com/">GitHub</a> was used. (Link to repository <a href="https://github.com/cristian-mihaitactin/StackTasor">Here</a> )
        </p>
        <p>
          For task management and distribution, the enormingly useful <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> was used. 
          Each complex aspect of the project was broken down in tab lists, later on being further fragmented and cristalized into individual tasks. 
          Each task contains a description (usually containing links with information of interest pertaining the task) and Github "Pull Request",
          linking the "requirement" aspect of the project to the "implementation". (Link to boards <a href="https://trello.com/b/trkEa8pN/staw-tasor">Here</a> )

      <section id="backend">
        <!-- review? -->
        <h3>Backend</h3>
        <p>
          The backend (or server side) technologies are all NodeJS and Javascript oriented. The server is hosted via the
           <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/express/">"express"</a> npm, and the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/azure-storage/">"azure-storage"</a> 
           npm was used to communicate with <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/tables/">"Azure Table Storage"</a>  as a means of 
          data storage.
        </p>
        <p>
          The server and client side communicate through an API configured using "Express routes".
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="frontend">
        <!-- review? -->
        <h3>Frontend</h3>
        <p>
          Frontend technologies include the "classic 3" Html, Css and Javascript. However, in order to achieve the PWA standard,
          a <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers">Service Worker</a> was added to manage 
          caching and events. A bare minimum of "Bootstrap" (for the navigation bar) and "Jquery" (for "hide" and "show" animation) was used. 
          The rest of of the technologies used on this end are Vanilla Javascript.
        </p>

      <section id="testing">
        <!-- review? -->
        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <p>
          For testing, the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine">jasmine npm</a> module is used. as well as 
          <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine-spec-reporter">jasmine-spec-reporter npm</a> module for better test feedback.

        <!-- review? -->
        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          Early on in the planning of the project, a decision to separate the client facing server and database interaction was made. And thus, the 
          concept of the "public" and "private" api's was born. This meant that any environment (local or live) cound target any database, making debugging and testing much easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          Communication between these api's is made through a common set of "contract entities". These are:
          <ul>
            <li>"user.js"</li>
            <li>"project.js"</li>
            <li>"task.js"</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <section id="publicapi">
          <h3>Public Api</h3>

            Live link: <a href="https://cristasor-public-win.azurewebsites.net">cristasor-public-win.azurewebsites.net</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            The "public" api is the one designated to face the client and serve the "html pages".
            Code snippet of the "/auth" action which enables a user to login:
            <pre><code>
              
router.post('/auth', async function(request, response) {
    console.log("router.post('/auth'");

	var form = new multiparty.Form();
 
    form.parse(request, async function(err, fields, files) {
        var username = fields.username;
        var password = fields.password;

        if (username && password) {
            var results = await authManager.userLogin(username, password);
            if (results.length > 0) {
                request.session.loggedin = true;
                request.session.username = username;
                request.session.userId = results[0].id;

                var _redirectLink = '/home';
                if (request.session.fromRedirect) {
                    _redirectLink = request.session.fromRedirectUrl;
                    request.session.fromRedirect = false;
                }
                response.status(200).send({
                    RedirectLink: _redirectLink,
                    Error: false
                });
            } else {
                response.status(400).send( {
                    Message: 'Incorrect Username and/or Password!',
                    Error: true
                });
                response.end();
            }
        } else {
            response.status(401).send( {
                Message: 'Please enter Username and Password!',
                Error: true
            });
            response.end();
        }
    });
});
            </code></pre>
          </p>
          <p>
            All of these actions are located in the "server-express.js" file. As a security precaution, the only files that the client 
            can access are the static ones:
            <pre>
              <code>
                app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/src'));
                app.use('/static', express.static(__dirname + '/views'));
                app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/pwa'));
              </code>
            </pre>
          </p>
          <p>
            Communication with the <a href="#privateapi">private api</a> is made through a set of services and managers.
            The server calls the "managers". These "managers" then manipulate the date so that they can call and interpret the "rest-services".
            These "services" are specialized modules that get,set,delete data via the "contract entities". As such, there is a "rest-service" for each 
            of these entities. The actual sending and receiving of data is made through a common "http-service.js" module.
          </p>

            The "private" api is the one designated to interact with "Azure Tables" that hold data. The API server is hosted via the "server.js" file and
            route management via the "routes.js" module. This routes module is the one directing requests to each specific controller. Each of these controllers
             returns a JSON object if the request was completed, or an error if not. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Communication with "Azure Tables" is made through a set repositories.
            The API facing the <a href="#publicapi">public api</a> presents controllers for each of the 3 entities (users, projects and tasks). 
            Each controller instantiates a repository that interacts with "Azure Tables" through a common "azureTableRepository.js" class that contains
            functions for getting/upserting/deleting an entry as well as getting multiple via a "query". If the table does not exist, the table is created on 
            the spot. The module establishes commnication with "Azure Tables" via a "Connection String" from the process settings "AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING". 
            All of the controller and repository classes accept dependencies as parameters, as to facilitate "Dependency Injection".
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a snippet for getting an entry from "azureTableRepository.js" class:
            <pre>
              <code>
      get(partitionKey, rowKey) {
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            this._tableService.retrieveEntity(this._tableName, partitionKey, rowKey, function (error, result, response) {
                if (! error) { // result contains the entity
                    console.log('Entity.datetime = ' + result.CreatedDate);
                    return resolve(result);
                } else {
                    reject("Unable to retrieve entity: PartitionKey: " + partitionKey + ", RowKey: " + rowKey + ". Error: " + error);
                }
            });
        });
    }

        <h3>Hosting</h3>
        <p>
          Hosting is done by using <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Azure Hosting</a> Services. The two servers (<a href="#privateapi">private</a> 
          and <a href="#publicapi">public</a> API's) are hosted on "App services", with logging provided "Application Insights".

        <h3>Problems encountered</h3>
        <p>
          As any project, developing the <strong>Cris-Tasor</strong> project has encountered some problems.
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          One of the issues tackled was the hosting on a live environment. As per "PWA" standard, https support was needed. When moving the project from local
          to a live environment, some architectural decisions were needed to be done. One of them was the contracts. Before hosting on a live environment, 
          the two api's were both targeting the same classes (in order to maintain common contracts). However, as NodeJS does not "build" the dependencies 
          into binary files via references, the classes had to be cloned and moved in each of the api project.
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          Another issue encountered was the web push api for notification. Although web notifications was easlily implemented, the "subscriptions" part of 
          the api has presented a very confusing and time-consuming documentation. After a day of analysing the documentation, a choice has presented itself: 
          either host a third api to manage notifications, or use a "Firebase" message service. Given the time constraint of the project, the "Firebase" option was 
          used. However, again, the confusing documentation ("what is the notification url?") and lack of practical examples, has forced the development team 
          to drop this feature. There is still a branch wating for this to finish.
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          The last, and biggest, issue encountered was the <strong>"css time drain"</strong>. The development team is specialized and experienced in backend technologies (bites, not px).
